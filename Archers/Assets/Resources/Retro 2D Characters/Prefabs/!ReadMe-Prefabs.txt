Hiya! Thanks once again for purchasing the pack.
Here's a few quick notes on the prefabs.

All the prefabs are set up to use the new template animator tree.
It is not driven by any script, but rather provided as a starting point.
So, right now, the only animation that'll play is the down-facing idle animation.
Use the template to integrate with your player character script and the like!

All the prefabs also include the SpriteSkin script.
The animation set provided in v 1.3 derives from a single spritesheet.
By using the SpriteSkin script, the animations don't have to be remade for every component, variation, etc.
You can also choose to use either the black outline style or color outline style.

Hope these new assets help!
